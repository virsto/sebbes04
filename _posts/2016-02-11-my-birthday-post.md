 This is a special day and special month --- why? Special day, because it's my birthday and special month because 2016 is a leap year with an extra day this month.

 BBC TV produces the world's first ever science fiction TV program, Nelson Mandela released from Victor Verster Prison outside Cape Town, Space Shuttle Discovery launched. Elsa Beskow (Swedish author and illustrator), Richard Hamming (American mathematican), Arne Jacobsen (Danish architect), Josiah Willard Gibbs (American physicist, mathematician, and academic), and Mathias Fredriksson (Swedish skier). What do all of these have in common? That's right --- they all happened on February 11th. What a day! 

I believe my parents have some presents for me --- but what? My parents might take me out  --- but where? I am really not sure what will happen today. 

Jag ska ha mitt kompiskalas tillsammans med min bästa vän Victor (som går i samma klass).
Jag vill  bjuda alla i klassen och det blir antagligen bowlingkalas. Sen ska vi också ha ett släktkalas.

I will report in my next blog, what presents I received and what I did on my birthday, so stay tuned!
